The Homosaurus is a thesaurus of terms used to describe LGBTQ+ materials. The thesaurus is
currently managed by a nine-person editorial board. The Homosaurus was developed by Jack van der Wel  in the 1980s as a tool for organizing Homodok, an archive of materials related to homosexuality located at the University of Amsterdam.  After founding the Digital Transgender Archive in 2013, K.J. Rawson, a U.S.-based researcher,  looked to the Queer Thesaurus to describe that archive. Working with van der Well, Rawson worked to update and transition it to an online linked data vocabulary called the Homosaurus.
