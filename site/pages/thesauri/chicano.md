The Chicano Thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary for describing Chicana/o/x collections. It was first proposed and spearheaded by staff at the Chicano Studies Library at UC Berkeley. Richard Chabr√°n, coordinator of the Chicano Studies Library from 1975-1979 helped build a network of Chicana/o/x library workers, known as the Committee for the Development of the Subject Access to Chicano Literatures to build a functional and meaningful thesaurus for Chicana/o/x collections. First published in 1979, the Chicano Thesaurus has gone through many technological changes and is now embedded in the Chicano Database, an electronic database of Chicana/o/x materials which is managed and updated by Lillian Castillo-Speed, Head Librarian of the Ethnic Studies Library at UC Berkeley.
