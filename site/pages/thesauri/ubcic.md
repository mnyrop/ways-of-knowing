The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) Revision of the Brian Deer Classification was created to reorganize materials in the Union of BC Indian Chiefs' Resource Centre. Prior to this reorganization, the library was in “classification limbo.” Part of the collection was organized using the Library of Congress Classification while another part was organized using a previous modification of the Brian Deeer Classification created by librarians Gene Joseph and Keltie McCall. An  influx of new materials sparked the revision in order to make the classifications consistent across the library. A new influx of materials sparked this new revision of the Deer led by Alissa Cherry with input from Brian Deer and Gene Joseph and support from Camille Callison.
