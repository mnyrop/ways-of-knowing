The Women’s Thesaurus was created to provide useful and relevant search terms for the study
of women’s history, culture, and experience. The vocabulary took shape in the context of a feminist movement that located progress in policy work, activism, and scholarship. As scholars, policymakers, and activists began writing and publishing their work, they had an acute need for access tools. In October 1982, Mary Ellen Capek, working under the auspices of the National Council for Research on Women convened a Thesaurus Task Force to address this need.  A Women's Thesaurus : An Index of Language Used to Describe and Locate Information By and About Women was Published in 1987.
